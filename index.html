                <div class="about--genericDescription">
                    <p>I am Iulia Burlacu, and I am an <span>art</span> lover who spent a long time experimenting with
                        visual arts,
                        trying to find myself and my style. The process felt like a true <span>adventure</span> in which
                        I explored
                        different worlds, such as oil and acrylic painting, watercolour and pencil drawing, which gave
                        me a <span>sense of purpose</span> and the determination to dive further into the unknown of
                        art. Slowly, I
                        started to understand the meaning of colour and shapes and their conventional and unconventional
                        artistic manifestations.</p>
